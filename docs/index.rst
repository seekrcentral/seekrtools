Seekrtools: Multiscale Milestoning Calculations of Kinetics Tools
=================================================================

:Release: |release|
:Date: |today|

**Seekrtools** Simulation Enabled Estimation of Kinetic Rates Tools
is a set of software tools that interfaces with SEEKR programs, 
most notably with SEEKR2, in order to prepare and facilitate multiscale
milestoning calculations.

Seekrtools provides content that can facilitate a number of tasks for SEEKR2
users, including:

 1. Documentation, sample scripts, and tutorials to help users prepare systems
    for SEEKR2 calculations, including

  * a. parametrization
  * b. minimization/equilibration
  * c. steered molecular dynamics (SMD) and other methods to generate starting structures
   
 2. More tools for analysis of SEEKR2 results.
 3. Additional example systems and SEEKR2 inputs to explore and test SEEKR2 
    features
   
  * New/experimental collective variables (CVs)
  * Unusual systems with multiple sites/important motions
  * New applications of milestoning theory
