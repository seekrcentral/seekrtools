Tutorial: Generating Trypsin/Benzamidine Starting Structures With HIDR
======================================================================

In this tutorial, we will be performing steered molecular dynamics (SMD) on the
equilibrated trypsin/benzamidine system to pull the ligand slowly out of the
bound state, saving structures along the way, which we can then turn around and 
use as starting structures for a SEEKR2 calculation. This will be accomplished
using the HIDR (Holo Insertion by Directed Restraints) tool.

.. note::
  This tutorial assumes that you are using a computer equipped with one or
  more graphical processing units (GPUs). If your computer doesn't have a GPU,
  then you will need to transfer all files over to a computer equipped with
  a GPU (and also with OpenMM installed) in order to run MD simulations.

Gather the Necessary Files
--------------------------

If you completed the parametrization tutorial in this series, namely, the
:doc:`Trypsin/Benzamidine system equilibration<tutorial_tryp_ben_equilibrate>`
, then you should have all the necessary files, but in case you don't, you
can download them below:

:download:`tryp_ben.prmtop <media/tryp_ben.prmtop>`

:download:`tryp_ben.inpcrd <media/tryp_ben.inpcrd>`

:download:`tryp_ben.pdb <media/tryp_ben.pdb>`

:download:`tryp_ben_receptor.pqr <media/tryp_ben_receptor.pqr>`

:download:`tryp_ben_ligand.pqr <media/tryp_ben_ligand.pqr>`

Constructing the SEEKR2 Model Input File
----------------------------------------

Just like SEEKR, the HIDR program needs a model.xml file in order to run, so
we will need to run the SEEKR2 prepare.py program on a Model Input file 
that contains no starting structures.

Download the following Model Input file:

:download:`input_tryp_ben_hidr.xml <media/input_tryp_ben_hidr.xml>`

Open up the file in a text viewer and take a look at the inputs. Notice that
every anchor has no <pdb_coordinates_filename> entries. This is because HIDR
is going to provide these for us. Notice however that the "tryp_ben.prmtop"
and PQR files were entered, since they do not vary by anchor.

First, we will run SEEKR2's prepare.py program to make us an empty model.::

  python ~/seekr2/seekr2/prepare.py input_tryp_ben_hidr.xml
  
Now the model XML file and the entire filetree has been generated at 
~/tryp_ben_hidr_tutorial/ (The <root_directory> tag in the Model input XML), 
but the model is empty - no PDB files define starting structures in any of
the anchor directories.

Running HIDR on the new Model using SMD
---------------------------------------

We will use HIDR's steered molecular dynamics (SMD) functions to slowly pull
the system into every anchor and save the structures for later SEEKR2
calculations.

.. note::
  HIDR can use other methods besides SMD to populate starting structures,
  including RAMD and ratcheting. Consult the HIDR documentation as well as
  other Seekrtools tutorials to see how to use these other methods if so
  desired. (Tutorials are still be under construction at the time of writing).

Run HIDR with the following command.::

  python ~/seekrtools/seekrtools/hidr/hidr.py any ~/tryp_ben_hidr_tutorial/model.xml -M SMD -p tryp_ben.pdb

This command is likely to run for hours or possibly days, depending on the 
speed of your GPU.

Additional HIDR Settings for SMD
--------------------------------

One can get a good overview of HIDR arguments by running HIDR with the "-h"
argument.::

  python ~/seekrtools/seekrtools/hidr/hidr.py -h
  
Some significant options include running a certain number of equilibration 
steps before any SMD is performed. For instance, adding the following argument 
will cause HIDR to perform 10,000,000 steps of equilibration (1 ns) before doing
any SMD::

  -e 10000000
  
One can also allow some equilibration steps in each anchor after the SMD has
brought it there (called "settling steps" in HIDR).::

  -S 20000000
  
By default, HIDR SMD will bring the system to each anchor at an approximate
speed of 0.01 nm/ns, which is a balance between fast enough to reach each 
anchor in a reasonable time, but also not too fast to avoid excessively
perturbing the system. But one can adjust this speed with the -v argument.
For instance, if one wants to perform SMD ten times faster (finishing in 
a tenth of the time, one may set the speed to 0.1 nm/ns.::

  -v 0.1

haven't already, visit the SEEKR2 tutorials to review how to run a SEEKR2
calculation, if needed.
