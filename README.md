seekrtools
==============================

Simulation-Enabled Estimation of Kinetic Rates Tools

Seekrtools is a set of software tools that interfaces with SEEKR programs, 
most notably with SEEKR2, in order to prepare and facilitate multiscale
milestoning calculations.

This README is only a quickstart guide to get Seekrtools up and running as soon 
as possible. To see more detailed **instructions** and **tutorials**, please see 
https://seekrtools.readthedocs.io/en/latest or the docs/ subfolder.

## Quick Install

### Dependencies
- SEEKR2
- OpenMM (see SEEKR2 documentation to install OpenMM alongside SEEKR2)

Make sure that you have installed SEEKR2 before Seekrtools.
(Most Seekrtools programs have SEEKR2 as a dependency). You can find the SEEKR2 
Github repostory at https://github.com/seekrcentral/seekr2.git
and the SEEKR2 documentation at https://seekr2.readthedocs.io/en/latest.


### Install Seekrtools
If you are using Mamba/Conda (recommended) with SEEKR, make sure that the 
environment is activated before executing the following steps to install 
Seekrtools:

```
git clone https://github.com/seekrcentral/seekrtools.git
cd seekrtools
python -m pip install .
```

Optionally, run unit tests:

```
pytest
```
